This Python script defines a simple stack class (`Stack`) to check if a given expression with parentheses, curly brackets, and square brackets is balanced. It then uses this stack to evaluate mathematical expressions and prints the result if the expression is balanced. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Stack Class:**
   - The class has an `__init__` method to initialize the stack with an empty list and set the top index to -1.
   - The `charPair` method checks if the given open and close characters form a valid pair. Additionally, it checks if the top of the stack is one of the characters '+', '*', or '/'.
   - The `Push` method pushes characters onto the stack and checks for balanced parentheses, curly brackets, and square brackets. It returns `True` if the expression is balanced, otherwise `False`.
   - The `pop` method pops the top element from the stack.
   - The `getTop` method returns the top element of the stack.
   - The `isEmpty` method checks if the stack is empty.
   - The `__str__` method returns a string representation of the stack.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The script then enters an infinite loop where the user is prompted to enter an expression.
   - A new instance of the `Stack` class (`myStack`) is created for each iteration.
   - The entered expression is passed to the `Push` method of the stack. If the expression is balanced, it prints the result of evaluating the expression using `eval`. Otherwise, it prints "Not Balanced."
   - An exception is raised if the user enters an invalid expression.

Here are a few comments and suggestions:

- The `charPair` method can be simplified by using a dictionary to store valid pairs.
- The code might benefit from additional comments to explain the purpose of each method and the overall workflow.
- The use of `eval` can be risky as it allows arbitrary code execution. Consider using safer alternatives to evaluate expressions.

Remember to handle edge cases and thoroughly test the code with various input scenarios to ensure its correctness and reliability.
